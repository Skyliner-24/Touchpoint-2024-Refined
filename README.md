This is the Repo for my TouchPoint 2024 Skin Refinement project I worked on for ~~*redacted to avoid being sued*~~ before I was rather graciously given the boot :3

None of this would have been possible without ICRTouch's jumping off point of their official 2024 skin, their tutorials were a gigantic help in the creation process alongside the community on the forums.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

The 1024x768 Version is deployment ready alongside its associated KEYCONV.074 file, this KEYCONV.074 is **required** for the assets to place correctly.

The 1366x768 Version is incomplete, when I was working at ~~*redacted to avoid being sued*~~ 1366x768 was an unorthodox resolution for us so this got minimal development time other than surface level functionality.
